## For Loop Practice Problems

### Count it up (did't we already do this??)

Ask the user for a number. Display a count from 0 up to the number in your output.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter a number:
8

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
I just counted to 8!
```

### Traverse a string

Ask the user for a name. Display a count of all the letter a's in the name.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter a name:
Atlanta

There are 3 a's in Atlanta
```

### Name Backwards

Ask the user for a name and display the name backwards.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter a name:
Atlanta

atnaltA

```

### Max and Min Values

Ask the user for 5 integers. Create a for loop structure that finds the max and min from the data entered.
