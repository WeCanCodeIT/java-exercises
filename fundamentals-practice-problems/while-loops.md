## While Loop Practice Problems

### Count it up

Ask the user for a number. Display a count from 0 up to the number in your output.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter a number:
8

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
I just counted to 8!
```

### Find the evens

Ask the user for a number. Display all the even numbers from 0 to that number and also keep track of the number of evens you found.
Hint: you may need to google how to find an even number in Java.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter a number:
8

2 4 6 8 
I just found 4 even numbers!
```

### User Name revisited

Ask the user for a user name of at least 4 characters in length. Continue prompting the user until they actually enter a user name that is long enough.

#### Examples

```bash
Enter a user name:
bob

not long enough! try again!

bob
still not long enough! try again!!!!

bobby
Welcome bobby!
```
