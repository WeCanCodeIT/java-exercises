## Week 4


### 1

Brush up on your biology and place the following in the proper hierarchy: Dog, Reptile, Animal, Mammal

### 2

#### Lets practice Equality 

- As a reference, use the slide deck from Equality and Sets from yesterday
- `mkdir` computer-equality 
- build in junit test dependency
- create a `Computer` class with make, model and price
- let's run the following tests:
  - run a test that 2 computer objects are Aliases of one another
  - run a test that object equals is being utilized correctly
  - run a test to assert that object equals is overridden by the `Computer` class (slide 6-8 will help!)
