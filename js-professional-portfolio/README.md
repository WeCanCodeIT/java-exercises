# Professional Portfolio with JS

## Overview

Upgrade your professional portfolio to include JS content. (No frameworks.)

## Tasks

All requirements from iteration one of this project should still be there. You are encouraged to make a multi page site this time around.

### Additions to your site

* Add an image carousel. This can be a carousel of screenshots of your projects (perhaps they link to your projects)
* Add a button in your navigation that will toggle the visibility of your actual site navigation.
* Add a button and collapsable description to your portfolio projects so when the user clicks the button the descriptions expand and collapse
* Create a modal box that pops up with your bio information whenever a button or link is pressed

### Stretch Goals

* Change layout with media queries based on viewport width. Feel free to use other specific media rules but base media queries should be based on viewport width. (Most common)
* Have the dropdown navigation menu only when at smaller viewports and the full navigation when at larger viewports
