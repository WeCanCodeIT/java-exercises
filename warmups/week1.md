## Week 1

### 1

In Eclipse access your week-1 project folder and create a class called **Columbus Facts**
  - Use proper naming conventions on **Columbus Facts** as the name of your class
  - Code the proper commands to print the following in your console
 
 ```bash
    Columbus is ranked 8th in U.S. cities for tech job growth
    Ranked first in Scaling startups
    Ranked top city for mid-career professionals 
   ```
  

### 2

In Eclipse access **ColumbusFacts** from yesterday
  - Add the line of output below, using concatenation to make the numbers numerical and not characters in the String
  
  `4280 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016`
  
  - Refactor your code to reference 2016 as a variable in the output statement
  - Your console should produce what is below
 
 ```bash
    Columbus is ranked 8th in U.S. cities for tech job growth
    Ranked first in Scaling startups
    Ranked top city for mid-career professionals 
    4280 new jobs were announced by over 80 companies in 2016
   ```

### 3

What is wrong with this code? Re-write using proper Java convention and syntax?

 ```bash
   
public class thursdaywarmup {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
 
  int testnumberone;
  int testnumbertwo;
  
  System.out.println("Enter number 1: ");
  testnumberone = input.nextDouble();
  System.out.println("Enter number 2:");
 
  int sum = testnumberone + testnumbertwo; 
   
   	System.out.println("The sum of the two numbers is 3");
   	
   }

}
   ```
